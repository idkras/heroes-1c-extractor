# Git Recovery Instructions for Heroes Advising Project

## Current Issue
The GitHub interface shows an "unknown error" because the local repository has diverged significantly from the remote (67 vs 19 commits). The Git index is locked by Replit's security system.

## Immediate Actions Required

### Option 1: Use Replit's Git Interface
1. Open the Version Control panel in Replit (left sidebar)
2. Click "Discard all changes" to reset to the last clean state
3. Then manually re-add your Product Heroes Season 22 files
4. Commit with message: "Update Product Heroes Season 22 structure"

### Option 2: Terminal Commands (if accessible)
```bash
# Navigate to workspace
cd /home/runner/workspace

# Force reset to match remote
git fetch origin
git reset --hard origin/main

# Re-add your important files
git add "[projects]/[product heroes] season22/"
git commit -m "Product Heroes Season 22 updates with actual dates"
git push origin main
```

### Option 3: Create New Branch
If main branch remains problematic:
```bash
git checkout -b heroes-season22-fix
git add "[projects]/[product heroes] season22/"
git commit -m "Season 22 structure with corrected dates and trial info"
git push origin heroes-season22-fix
```

## Files to Preserve
The following files contain your completed work:
- `[projects]/[product heroes] season22/[skills · outputs]/structure · skills.md`
- `[projects]/[product heroes] season22/[skills · outputs]/course_navigation_graph.md`
- `[projects]/[product heroes] season22/CHANGELOG_season22_updates.md`

## What Was Completed
Your Product Heroes Season 22 structure is ready with:
- Corrected dates (June 10 - July 5, 2025)
- Proper trial 6 description (B2B/B2C cohorts from GA/CRM)
- Clear distinction between final trial 10 and bonus trial 11
- All skills formatted as action verbs
- Complete navigation graph showing skill progression

The content is production-ready and can be used immediately for the course.
