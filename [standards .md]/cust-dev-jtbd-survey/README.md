# Customer Development & JTBD Survey Framework

## üìã Overview

This framework provides comprehensive guidance for conducting high-quality customer research using Customer Development and Jobs-to-be-Done (JTBD) methodologies. Based on the work of Steve Blank, Clayton Christensen, and modern qualitative research best practices.

## üéØ Purpose

- **Eliminate survey bias** and sampling errors that lead to poor business decisions
- **Conduct effective interviews** that reveal true customer motivations
- **Avoid common pitfalls** in customer research and data interpretation
- **Generate actionable insights** for product development and marketing

- Complete methodology based on Steve Blank and Clayton Christensen frameworks
- Theoretical foundations and practical implementation
- Integration with existing quality standards (TaskMaster, Registry, JTBD Scenarium)

### 2. **Practical Scripts**

- Ready-to-use interview scripts for Customer Development and JTBD interviews
- Question templates by research goal and industry
- Conversation starters and difficult situation handlers
- Remote interview adaptations

### 3. **Analysis Framework**
[`analysis_frameworks.md`](./analysis_frameworks.md)
- Structured approaches for analyzing interview data
- Pattern recognition and bias detection frameworks
- Job statement creation and validation
- Actionable insights generation

### 4. **Mistakes Prevention**
[`common_mistakes_prevention.md`](./common_mistakes_prevention.md)
- Detailed breakdown of fatal interview mistakes
- Survey design problems and solutions
- Quality assurance checklists
- Recovery strategies when things go wrong

## üöÄ Quick Start Guide

### Step 1: Understand the Problems
Read the core standard to understand why traditional surveys fail:
- Response bias (social desirability, acquiescence)
- Sampling bias (self-selection, convenience sampling)
- Question design bias (leading questions)
- Interviewer bias (confirmation bias)

### Step 2: Prepare Your Interview
1. Use the interview scripts and templates
2. Define your research objective clearly
3. Recruit diverse participants (not just satisfied customers)
4. Set up recording equipment
5. Prepare neutral, open-ended questions

### Step 3: Conduct the Interview
Follow the structured approach:
- **People** (5 min): Understand their context and role
- **Problems** (20 min): Discover real pain points and triggers
- **Solutions** (10 min): Explore current alternatives and validate concepts

### Step 4: Analyze Results
- Extract key quotes and emotional moments
- Look for patterns across multiple interviews
- Create job statements using the JTBD framework
- Validate insights against behavioral evidence

### Step 5: Act on Insights
- Prioritize findings by impact and confidence
- Create testable hypotheses
- Design experiments to validate assumptions
- Iterate based on learnings

## üìä Key Principles

### **90/10 Rule**
Listen 90% of the time, talk 10% of the time

### **Concrete Over Hypothetical**
Ask about specific past experiences, not future intentions

### **Problems Before Solutions**
Understand the problem deeply before discussing solutions

### **Patterns Over Anecdotes**
Look for consistent themes across multiple interviews

### **Behavior Over Stated Preferences**
Focus on what people actually do, not what they say they'll do

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Critical Mistakes to Avoid

### **The Pitch Trap**
Don't explain your solution until you understand their problem

### **The Leading Question Trap**
Avoid questions that guide toward your desired answer

### **The Hypothetical Trap**
Don't ask "would you" questions - ask about actual experiences

### **The Feature Voting Trap**
Don't ask customers to prioritize features - understand their jobs

### **The Confirmation Bias Trap**
Actively seek evidence that contradicts your hypotheses
