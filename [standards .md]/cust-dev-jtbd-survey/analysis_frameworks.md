# Analysis Frameworks for Customer Development & JTBD Interviews

## Interview Analysis Workflow

### 1. Raw Data Processing
```
Step 1: Immediate Post-Interview (within 24 hours)
□ Review audio recording
□ Extract key quotes verbatim
□ Note emotional moments and body language
□ Identify contradictions or surprising statements
□ Write initial impressions while fresh

Step 2: Detailed Analysis (within 48 hours)
□ Full transcript review
□ Code for themes and patterns
□ Map to research questions
□ Identify follow-up questions needed
□ Document lessons learned about interview technique
```

### 2. Pattern Recognition Framework
```
Look for patterns across 3-5 interviews:

Consistency Patterns:
- Same triggers mentioned repeatedly
- Similar emotional responses to situations
- Common obstacles or barriers
- Repeated language or phrases
- Consistent decision-making criteria

Divergence Patterns:
- Different approaches to same problem
- Varying priorities or values
- Contradictory statements about importance
- Different segments behaving differently
- Unique edge cases or special circumstances
```

## JTBD Analysis Framework

### Forces of Progress Analysis
```
For each interview, map the four forces:

PUSH FORCES (Problems with current state):
- Functional problems: "What doesn't work?"
- Emotional problems: "What's frustrating?"
- Social problems: "What's embarrassing?"

PULL FORCES (Attraction to new solution):
- Functional attraction: "What capabilities appeal?"
- Emotional attraction: "What feelings does it promise?"
- Social attraction: "What status does it provide?"

HABIT FORCES (Attachment to status quo):
- Functional habits: "What's familiar and easy?"
- Emotional habits: "What feels safe?"
- Social habits: "What's expected by others?"

ANXIETY FORCES (Concerns about new solution):
- Functional anxiety: "What might break?"
- Emotional anxiety: "What might be stressful?"
- Social anxiety: "What might others think?"
```

### Job Statement Creation
```
Template: "When [situation], I want to [motivation], so I can [desired outcome]"

Validation Criteria:
□ Situation is specific and triggerable
□ Motivation is clear and actionable
□ Outcome is measurable and valuable
□ Statement is solution-agnostic
□ Passes "wake up in the morning" test
□ Would be relevant 100 years ago
□ Focuses on progress, not features

Example Refinement:
❌ "I want to use a CRM to track customers"
✅ "When I'm trying to follow up with potential customers, I want to remember our previous conversations and their specific interests, so I can have relevant, personalized discussions that move us toward a business relationship"
```

## Customer Development Analysis

### Problem-Solution Fit Analysis
```
For each identified problem, evaluate:

Problem Characteristics:
- Frequency: How often does this occur?
- Intensity: How painful is it when it happens?
- Scope: How many people experience this?
- Cost: What's the cost of not solving it?
- Urgency: How quickly do people need it solved?

Current Solutions Analysis:
- What do people do today?
- How well do current solutions work?
- What's missing from current solutions?
- What workarounds do people use?
- What alternatives are people considering?

Market Opportunity Assessment:
- Who experiences this problem most acutely?
- What would they pay to solve it?
- How do they currently budget for solutions?
- What's their decision-making process?
- Who else is involved in the decision?
```

### Segment Definition Framework
```
Define segments based on:

Situational Factors:
- When does the problem occur?
- What triggers the need?
- What constraints do they face?
- What resources do they have?

Behavioral Factors:
- How do they currently solve it?
- What's their decision-making process?
- How do they evaluate solutions?
- What's their adoption pattern?

Outcome Factors:
- What success looks like to them
- How they measure progress
- What they're optimizing for
- What they're willing to sacrifice
```

## Quote Analysis System

### Quote Categorization
```
Functional Quotes:
"It takes me 3 hours every week to compile this report"
"The system crashes every time I try to import data"
"I have to use 5 different tools to get one answer"

Emotional Quotes:
"It's so frustrating when..."
"I feel stupid when I can't figure out..."
"I'm embarrassed to ask for help with..."

Social Quotes:
"My boss expects me to..."
"The team depends on me to..."
"Everyone else seems to..."

Behavioral Quotes:
"I always start by..."
"My first instinct is to..."
"I never do X because..."
```

### Quote Validation
```
For each key quote, ask:
□ Is this representative of others' experiences?
□ Does this align with observed behavior?
□ Is this a stated preference or revealed preference?
□ Are there contradictions elsewhere in the interview?
□ Does this reflect emotion, or rational thinking?
```

## Bias Detection Framework

### Response Bias Detection
```
Social Desirability Indicators:
- Overly positive responses
- Reluctance to admit problems
- Alignment with perceived "right" answers
- Inconsistency with behavioral evidence

Acquiescence Bias Indicators:
- Agreeing with all statements
- Lack of strong opinions
- Following interviewer's lead
- Avoiding conflict or disagreement
```

### Interviewer Bias Detection
```
Review your interview for:
□ Leading questions (starting with "Don't you think...")
□ Confirmation seeking (pushing for agreement)
□ Assumption validation (explaining your thoughts)
□ Emotional reactions (showing disappointment/excitement)
□ Premature solution pitching
```

## Decision Making Analysis

### Decision Journey Mapping
```
For each customer decision journey:

Trigger Phase:
- What caused initial awareness?
- What was the emotional state?
- What constraints existed?
- Who else was involved?

Research Phase:
- What information did they seek?
- Where did they look?
- What criteria did they develop?
- What options did they consider?

Evaluation Phase:
- How did they compare options?
- What was most important?
- What concerns did they have?
- How did they resolve concerns?

Decision Phase:
- What was the final deciding factor?
- What overcame final hesitation?
- How did they justify the decision?
- What was their confidence level?
```

### Buying Process Analysis
```

Individual Level:
- Personal motivations
- Individual constraints
- Personal criteria
- Individual concerns

Organizational Level:
- Organizational needs
- Budget processes
- Approval requirements

- How do they interact?
- What's their relative power?
```

```

### Data Quality Validation
```
For each finding, validate:
□ Is it based on multiple data points?

## Actionable Insights Framework

### Insight Prioritization Matrix
```
For each insight, rate:
- Impact: How much would addressing this affect customers?
- Confidence: How sure are we about this insight?
- Effort: How difficult would it be to address?
- Urgency: How quickly do we need to act?

High Impact + High Confidence + Low Effort = Quick Wins
High Impact + High Confidence + High Effort = Strategic Bets
Low Impact + Low Confidence = Further Research Needed
```

### Testable Hypothesis Creation
```
For each insight, create testable hypotheses:

Hypothesis Format:
"We believe that [specific customer segment] experiences [specific problem] when [specific situation] because [underlying reason]. We will know this is true when [specific measurable outcome]."

Example:
"We believe that small business owners experience cash flow anxiety when managing customer payments because they lack visibility into when payments will arrive. We will know this is true when 70% of small business owners we survey report checking their bank accounts daily and express concerns about payment timing."
```
